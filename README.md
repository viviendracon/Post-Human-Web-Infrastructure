# A New Architecture for Post-Human Web Infrastructure
## **Abstract**

In this whitepaper, we propose a visionary yet concrete reimagining of the Internet’s architecture for an era of intelligent agents and decentralized knowledge. We outline a **post-human web** that shifts from today’s document-centric paradigm to a **semantic, data-centric web** in which AI agents mediate information access. This new architecture replaces traditional web technologies – like HTML pages, client-side scripting, and ad-hoc authentication – with **AI-native constructs**: structured data, cryptographic identity, dual-consent encryption, and personalized AI-driven interfaces. By leveraging open standards and decentralization (e.g. **Solid data pods, schema.org vocabularies, IPFS storage, decentralized identifiers**), this model aims to enhance security, accessibility, and user sovereignty. Small local language models (e.g. LLaMA 2, Mistral 7B) running on personal devices would collaborate with larger cloud AIs in *ad hoc* federations, forming a distributed intelligence network. We address practical steps for implementing this vision over the next 3–5 years, discuss how it can evolve alongside legacy systems, and examine potential hurdles. **Risks and ethical considerations** – from the centralization of AI power and economic disruption of content creators, to issues of privacy, epistemology, and digital identity – are analyzed with a view toward mitigation. The paper concludes by exploring the implications of an AI-mediated web for knowledge, power, and the future of human–digital agency.
